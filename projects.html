  <div class='pj mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://github.com/darkninja1'"><img src='projectPics/aracari-1.jpg' /> <h2>Aracari (In Development)</h2><p>News website focused on the authenticity of news. Using various algorithms and user based verification systems we plan to set up a stable channel of unbiased news.</p></div>
  <div class='pj rainbowio mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://dapchat.github.io/dapchat/'"><img src='projectPics/dapchat-1.png' /> <h2>DapChat</h2><p>A Chat software that I developed in 2022-2023 (10th grade) as a hobby project. This includes about 10 different other apps/games that are connected (todolists, reaction games, word games, typing games, fake instagram, radios, etc...]). It has some issues due to me still exploring how to program in 10th grade but it was a great learning experience. I take pride in the fact that I implemented features that many large orginisations added to thier platforms after me (ex: youtube music[radio feature], discord[backgrounds, shop, borders, animated backgrounds, non-numerical ids, etc...]) At one point i almost thought they copied me haha. (btw still has dozens of features that discord will most likely never impelement).</p></div>
  <div class='pj mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://dahonzak.github.io/EagleProject/'"><img src='projectPics/orienteering.png' /> <h2>Takoma Park Orienteering</h2><p>An Orienteering App as well as my 2024 (11th grade) Glen & Melinda Award Winning Eagle Scout project that allows you to do orienteering in Takoma Park (may be expanded soon).  </p></div>
  <div class='pj mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://github.com/DAPChat'"><img src='projectPics/dcg-1.jpeg' /> <h2>DCG</h2><p>A card game similar to if Yugioh and Pokemon were combined. Created as an end-of-semester project for video game design class. Pictures were scarce so I'll try to find some later but it was a card game with gameplay on multiplayer servers with login created in Godot. As far as I am concerned we were the first people to create p2p in godot from scratch and thus we had a lot of freedom making the game.</p></div>
  <div class='pj mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://github.com/darkninja1'"><img src='projectPics/ronzi-1.png' /> <h2>Ronzi</h2><p>A Chat software that I developed in 2021-2022 (9th grade) as a end of the year project for AP Java (Not in Java).  </p></div>
