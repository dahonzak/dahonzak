  <div class='pj rainbowio mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking' onmousemove='mouseMove(event)' onclick="location.href='https://dapchat.repl.co/'"><img src='projectPics/dapchat-1.png' /> <h2>DapChat</h2><p>A Chat software that I developed in 2022-2023 (10th grade) as a hobby project. This includes about 8 different other apps/games that are connected. Also I am fully aware of the vulnerabilities as well as the complete lack of efficiancy, orginisation, and method use. The reasons I did not incorperate these is because in the process of developing this project I was learning. As for why I have not redone stuff in process that is because its over 20,000 lines of code seperated in over some 80+ files (needs a redo). But Check it out you dont really have to worry about much its fun :) I take pride in the fact that I implemented features that many large orginisations added to thier platforms after me (ex: youtube music[radio feature], discord[backgrounds, shop, borders, animated backgrounds, non-numerical ids, etc...]) At one point i almost thought they copied me haha. (btw still has dozens of features that discord will most likely never impelement so go ahead and check it out).</p></div>
